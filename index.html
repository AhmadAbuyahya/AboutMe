            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Ahmad Abuyahya, I am from Jordan, I'm 23 years old, I have a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Al-Balqaa Applied University, I worked before as a maintenance technician in an industrial mill for a few months,
                the reason I didn't last too long in that field is because I didn't find it suitable for me, which is why I'm 
                learning coding right now because I think a career in tech is more suitable for my personality and my abilities in general.
            </p>
